   Notes
------------
- "git init" is used to initializing a new repo to git

------------ 
 git ignore
------------
- "touch .gitignore" line is used to add files that should be ignored when commiting to git. For example, if you have any files with confidential information like api keys, you can add the file name into 
   the git ignore file.

- you need to write the exact casing of the files, one file per line
- you can use the "#" to comment


------------
 git clone
------------
- git clone can be used to grab repo from github to local folder on your computer --> " git clone <link from github>"



--------------------
Branching & Merging
--------------------
 
 "git branch <name of new branch>"

 "git branch" --> to check which branches you currently have, the * indicates which branch you're currently on

 when you want to merge your branch with the master node:
"git merge <branch name>" --  it'll open up vim, leave it empty and write ":q!"


then you can push it with:  "git push origin master -u"


--------------------------
Forking and Pull Requests
--------------------------

- forking is taking a copy of a repository to your remote repo and making changes that don't affect the original repo you forked it from.
- Once you forked, you can clone it to your local repository
- If you want to tell the original owner to add your changes to the original repo, then you need to run a "pull request"
